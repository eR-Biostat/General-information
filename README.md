# The >eR-Biostat initative: Making R based education materials assessable for all
One of the main problems in high education at both under graduate and master levels in developing countries is the lack of high quality , R based, course materials for courses in education programs. The **>eR-Biostat**  initiative is focused on educaion programs (both under graduate and master) in Biostatistics/Statistics and aim to develop new E-learning system for courses at different education  level.

The E-learning system, developed as a part of the **>eR-Biostat**  initiative, offers free online course materials for under graduate and master students in biostatistics/statistics in developing countries. For each course, the materials are publicly available and consist of several type of course materials: 
* Notes for the course.
* Slides for the course.
* R programs, ready to use, which contain all data and R code for the all examples and illustrations discussed in the course.
* Homework assignments and exams.

The **>eR-Biostat** initiative introduces a new, R based, learning system, the multi-module learning system,  in which the students in the local universities in developing countries will be able to follow courses in different learning format, including e-courses taken online and a combination between e-courses and local lectures given by local staff members. R software and packages are used in all courses as data analysis tool for all examples and illustrations. The **>eR-Biostat**  initiative provides a free, accessible and ready to use tool for capacity building in biostatistics/statistics for local universities in developing countries with current low or near zero capacity in these topics. In its nurture, the R community is used for this type of collaboration (for example, CRAN and Bioconductor which offer access to the most up-to-date R packages for data analysis). The **>eR-Biostat**  initiative is aimed to bring the R community members for the development of high education courses in the same way it is currently done in software development.

# Our philosophy
Our Github page provides courses in statistics from different sources.  As such, it serves as  hub page for different course developers  so our users, both teachers and students, can find their courses in our Github page. Our  main target is to make  R based education materials assessable for all. We develop education materials in different levels:
* Introductory courses.
* Under graduate courses.
* Master level courses.

All courses are available for free to download, some are developed as **offline courses** (see for the example the course **Introduction to R** in the introductory course cluster) and some are developed as **online  courses** (see for example the course **Linear models** in the under graduate course cluster).
All courses are:
* Free.
* Ready to download and use in the class.
